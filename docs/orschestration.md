# Orchestration Overview

## Purpose

This document outlines the orchestration strategy and architectural principles followed across environments.

---

## Principles

- **Unified Orchestration**  
  Centralized orchestration of tools and workflows to ensure consistency and maintainability.

- **End-to-End Lineage**  
  Full traceability of data pipelines from ingestion to consumption.

- **Dependency-Based Scheduling**  
  Execution of jobs based on logical and operational dependencies.

- **Asset-Based Orchestration** *(Future Use Case)*  
  Data assets will be managed and orchestrated as first-class citizens.

- **Non-Monolithic Pipelines**  
  Pipelines are modular and maintainable, avoiding large tightly coupled workflows.

---

## Components

- **Ingestion**  
  Tools: Fivetran, dltHub, AutoLoader, LakeFlow, etc.

- **Transformation Jobs**  
  Tools: dbt, Databricks Notebooks

- **Analytics & Data Activation Refreshes**  
  Tools: Power BI, 3rd party data shares, and other external data consumers

---

## Approach

Orchestration is structured around **modular**, **environment-specific** workflows that are:

- Easy to manage
- Scalable across teams and projects
- Aligned with deployment standards
- Designed for consistency and traceability
